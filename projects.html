				<p class="white-text-two">I have built and maintained the various iterations of the website for this company since 2004, using either Adobe Dreamweaver or proprietary contact management systems. But this redesign project required a much more intimate knowledge of coding than previously needed and a finished product within only 2 days.
				</p>
				<p class="white-text-two">The needs of this project presented me with the opportunity to use a template and work with source code that was written by someone other than myself, which was something I had not done up until that point.
				</p>
				<p class="white-text-two">The template came from https://html5up.net/spectral and I modified or restructured appropriate aspects of the code to produce a finished product that fit the client’s needs.

				<h4 class="project-tech">Jay Hunt Designs</h4>
				<p class="white-text-two">Jasmine Hunter is a fashion designer that I met at my local Panera Bread restaurant (I have obtained 3 of my clients from hanging out there!). Miss Hunter wanted a site that had a clean and simple design, but was elegant and utilized the colors black, white, silver and gold.
				</p>
				<p class="white-text-two">The challenge I was faced with in order to complete this project had to do with the cross browser compatibility of the auto scrolling feature I built into the homepage of the site. I do the testing of my builds on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and Opera. The auto scrolling feature worked on all of those browsers except for Firefox.
				</p>
				<p class="white-text-two">After researching the issue through Google searches I finally found a solution that took care of the issue.

<!-- Goodie Treats -->
			<div class="project-text-left" id="proj-des3">
				<h4 class="project-tech">Goodie Treats</h4>
					<p class="white-text-two">The focus of the Goodie Treats organization is to build the self esteem of minority children, girls in particular, through various activities and events. The request of the client was that I made the entire homepage function as the initial menu for the site and also that it featured images from some of their events, but they wanted the rest of the site to be a simple design that featured big background images.
					</p>
					<p class="white-text-two">The challenging homepage request from the client provided me with an opportunity to explore using a responsive grid system to build the home page. Building the site’s homepage to spec allowed me to grasp the basic concepts and usefulness of using a grid, as well as experiment with its responsiveness to various screen sizes.

				<h4 class="project-tech">Rapture Guns & Knives</h4>
				<p class="white-text-two">During a visit to a local gun store for some target ammo, I overheard the store owner that he was in need of a website but didn’t have the knowledge on how to do it. I took that opportunity to introduce myself and shortly afterwards he became my client.
				</p>
				<p class="white-text-two">Because the majority of his customers were over the age of 50, the client wanted a very simple site that would appeal to the “nothing fancy” character of his customer base and that was modelled after the website for Gunsmoke Guns (now closed) out of Wheat Ridge, Colorado.
				</p>
				<p class="white-text-two">The challenge that I had in building this website had to do more with content than it did with any technical obstacles. I had to compose all of the copy for the website based on a recorded interview I conducted with the owner.
